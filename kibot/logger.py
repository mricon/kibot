"""
A module for convenient yet powerful file-object logging

BASIC USAGE

  from logger import Logger

  log = Logger(threshold=0)    # create the log object and give it
                               # a threshold of 0
  log.log(2, 'all done')       # send a log of priority 2 (not printed)
  log(0, 'error: bandits!')    # send a log of priority 0 (printed)
  log.write(0, stringvar)      # do a raw write on the file object

DESCRIPTION

  Each logging object is given a threshold.  Any messages that are
  then sent to that object are logged only if their priority meets or
  exceeds the threshold.  Lower numerical priority means that a
  message is more important.  For example: if a log object has
  threshold 2, then all messages of priority 2, 1, 0, -1, etc will be
  logged, while those of priority 3, 4, etc. will not.  I suggest the
  following scale:

     LOG PRIORITY    MEANING
              -1     failure - cannot be ignored
               0     important message - printed in default mode
               1     informational message - printed with -v
               2     debugging information

        THRESHOLD    MEANING
              -1     quiet mode (-q) only failures are printed
               0     normal operation
               1     verbose mode (-v)
               2     debug mode (-vv or -d)

  It can be extended farther in both directions, but that is rarely
  useful.  It can also be shifted in either direction.  This might be
  useful if you want o supply the threshold directly on the command
  line but have trouble passing in negative numbers.  In that case,
  add 1 to all thresholds and priorities listed above.

BASIC OPTIONS

  There are a couple of basic options that are commonly needed.  These
  are attribues of instances of class Logger.

  preprefix

    Text that will be printed at the start of each line of output (for
    log()ged, not write()en messages).  This might be your program's
    name, for example.

      log.preprefix = 'myprog'

    If preprefix is callable, then it will be called for each log and
    the returned value will be used.  This is useful for printing the
    current time.

      import time
      def printtime():
          return time.strftime('%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S ',
                               time.localtime(time.time()))
      log.preprefix = printtime

  file_object

    This is the file object to which output is directed.

LOG CONTAINERS

  If you want a program to log to multiple destinations, it might be
  convenient to use log containers.  A log container is an object
  which hold several log objects.  When you log to a log container it
  passes the message on (with optional tests) to each of the log
  objects it contains.  For example:

    from logger import Logger, LogContainer

    system = Logger(threshold=1, file_object=logfile)
    debug  = Logger(threshold=5, file_object=sys.stdout)
    log = LogContainer([system, debug])

    log(3, 'sent to system and debug, but only debug will print it')
    log(0, 'very important, both will print it')

  In this mode, log containers are just shorthand for calling all
  contained objects with the same priority and message.

  When a log object is held in a container, it can still be used
  directly.  For example, you can still do

    debug(3, ['this will not be sent to the system log, even if its',
              ' threshold is set very high'])

  (Yes, you can send lists of strings and they will be formatted on
  different lines.  It is pretty smart.)

ADVANCED

  There are a number of options available for both classes.  These are
  documented below, in the respective classes and methods.  Here is a
  list of some of the things you can do:

    * make the prefix contain a string which gets repeated for more
      important logs.  (prefix)
    * directly test if a log object WOULD log, so you can do
      complicated stuff, like efficient for loops. (test)
    * make the priority, threshold arbitrary objects, with a
      home-rolled test to see if it should log. (test)
    * give log containers a "master threshold" and define arbitrary
      behavior based on it.  Examples include:
      - only pass on messages of sufficient priority (ragardless of
        the thresholds of the log ojects).
      - only pass on messages to objects whose thresholds are
        (numerically) lower than the master threshold.

  demo section.
