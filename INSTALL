This file discusses the installation of kibot.  For help getting kibot
to run, see the README file.  For help using kibot once it's running,
see the manpages, documents in doc, and the "online" help.

INSTALLING FROM SOURCE

  To install kibot directly from source, run the following command:

  $ ./setup.py install

  You may find the --prefix option helpful if you want to install in a
  non-standard location, such as a home directory.  By default, it
  will install under /usr/local. See the python setuptools
  documentation for more information.
