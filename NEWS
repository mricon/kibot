0.0.13
======

For its first release since 2003, kibot has undergone a few
changes. This should be considered a transitional release. The
documentation has not been updated, and some commands have been
removed with no replacements.

Bug fixes and new features:

* Fix a problem where all users created in the same kibot session
  would share a reference to the same permissions list.

* Fix a number of bad variable references.

* Channel keys are now stored across kibot sessions, which fixes
  joining password protected channels on start.

* Fix a number of variables named the same as Python builtins, along
  with other issues found by pylint.

Modern Python support:

Many changes have happened in Python since 2003. kibot now uses a new
build system and relies on some new things in the standard library.

* Use setuptools for kibot configuration/installation.

* Use setuptools entrypoints for module registration. This allows you
  to extend kibot in a more easily packaged way.

* Remove usage of deprecated modules (sha, string)

* Access all modules in the kibot package with PEP328 style relative
  imports

* Replace the "timeoutsocket" module with Python 2.3's built-in socket
  timeouts

* Updated python-irclib to 0.4.8.

Module pruning:

* Some of kibot's modules are showing their age, and I've stripped
  things down to a smaller core list. The older modules can be easily
  recreated and packaged with the new kibot.modules entrypoint in
  setuptools.

  Removed:

    * acro
    * bugzilla
    * google
    * magic
    * slashdot
    * units
    * whereis

  Remaining:

    * auth (irc user permissions and ops management)
    * base (bot life cycle management)
    * irc (irc commands)
    * log (channel logging)
    * messaging (store-and-forward message system for offline users)
    * rand (quotes database)

0.0.12
  * Separation of the 'op' perm into 'op' and 'autoop'.  'op' now ONLY
    allows you to execute the 'op' command.  As you might have guessed,
    'autoop' will cause you to be automatically op-ed when you join
    a channel, etc.

    Bot owners with a pre-0.0.12 install will see everyone suddenly
    stop being op-ed.  All bot owners should do:
      addgrant manager autoop
    so that 'autoop' can be granted (by managers).  If you want to
    continue the old behavior, you should also do
      addimply op autoop
    so that everyone with 'op' automatically has 'autoop'.

  * The 'profile_change' event has been removed and replaced with
    several more fine-grained events.  This should not affect normal
    users, but it could conceivably affect custom modules that use the
    'profile_change' event.

0.0.9
  * Minor changes to the way stashers and settings work.  Now, by default
    when a stasher loads, it will not create attribues that were not in
    the stasher.  Previously, it would fill in these values with None.  The
    new way is actually much more convenient, but minor changes may need
    to be made.  self._unstash and self._stash now take an option argument
    that is the default to be used if an item isn't defined.  Using None
    for this argument recreates the old behavior.

0.0.8
  * The structure of magic data (magic.pickle) has changed, and so data
    created under version 0.0.7 can probably not be used in 0.0.8.
    Sorry.

0.0.3
  * Handling of the ircdb file has changed.  If you want to keep your
    list of Known Users, you'll need to convert to the new format with
    the following commands:

      cd data;   # your bot's data directory
      python2 /usr/share/doc/mbot-0.0.3/ircdb-convert.py ircdb ircdb.pickle

    If you've used different paths or filenames, you'll need to adjust
    accordingly.
